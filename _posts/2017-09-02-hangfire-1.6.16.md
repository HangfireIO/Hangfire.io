This is yet another maintenance release that fixes a bunch of non-critical bugs in `Hangfire.Core` and `Hangfire.SqlServer` packages.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – Unexpected `DateTime` and `DateTime?` serialization issues in background job arguments (by @plaisted).
* **Fixed** – `DistributedLockTimeoutException` in some background processes now logged with "DEBUG" level instead of "ERROR".
* **Fixed** – `ElmahLogProvider` to show errors when using SQL log (by @francnuec).
* **Fixed** – Last execution field isn't shown on recurring jobs page, when background job has already expired.
* **Fixed** – `Hangfire.SqlServer` assembly doesn't include version in the `netstandard` target.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – Lower the number of requests, when trying to acquire a distributed lock.
* **Fixed** – Problems with continuations and batch continuations, when using existing `SqlConnection` instance.
* **Fixed** – Distributed locks were silently released, when passing explicit closed connection to a storage.
* **Fixed** – `KeyNotFoundException` errors on various dashboard pages don't appear anymore (by @benjymous).
* **Fixed** – "Cannot release the application lock because it is not currently held" exceptions, when connection was closed.
* **Fixed** – Allow to use zero timeout for SQL Server-based distributed locks.
