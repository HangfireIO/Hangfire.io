This release fixes a bug appeared in version [1.5.6](/blog/2016/04/25/hangfire-1.5.6.html) of the `Hangfire.SqlServer` package. There was a race condition between the `Timer` and `Worker` threads, that causes the following problems, especially when small background jobs are processed.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Changed** – Disable immediate execution of a keep-alive query in queue and distributed locks.
* **Fixed** – Background jobs may be processed multiple times.
* **Fixed** – Keep-alive queries sometimes failing to execute.

Please see the [corresponding release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.5.8) on GitHub for linked issues/PRs.
