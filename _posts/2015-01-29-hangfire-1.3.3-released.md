This is a correcting release. Fixed a bug related to MSMQ or RabbitMQ extensions, when enqueued job is not processed and "stuck" in the *Enqueued* state indefinitely until we retry it manually.

### Release Notes

* **Fixed** – Enqueued job is not processed with MSMQ or RabbitMQ.

Please see the corresponding [GitHub Release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.3.3) for the details.

### Upgrading

Just update the `Hangfire.Core` NuGet package as usually:

    Update-Package Hangfire.Core
