This is yet another maintenance release with added support for dashes in queue names (thanks, @augustoproiete), better recurring job error messages in Dashboard UI and some other useful fixes.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Changed** – Add support for dash characters (`-`) in queue names (by @augustoproiete).
* **Fixed** – Show actual error in Dashboard UI when recurring job can't be scheduled.
* **Fixed** – Ensure backward compatibility when JSON payloads are serialized with field names only.
* **Fixed** – Non-awaited continuations can bring down the whole app when `TaskScheduler` is set to `null`.
* **Fixed** – Timeout value is not respected in some cases in the `WaitOneAsync` method.
