title: HangFire 0.9 Released
---

### Recurring jobs

This version brings incredibly easy method of scheduling and running recurring jobs inside ASP.NET applications. You need to call only a single line of code to perform this task:

```csharp
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(() => Console.Write("Easy!"), Cron.Daily);
```

The `Cron` class provides different easy to use methods and overloads to set up recurring jobs on a minutely, hourly, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. It is also possible to use more complex [CRON expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression), since the [`NCrontab`](https://code.google.com/p/ncrontab/) library is being used to perform scheduling logic.

```csharp
RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate(
    () => Console.Write("Powerful!"), 
    "0 12 * */2");
```

HangFire will check the schedule each minute and enqueue recurring jobs as regular background jobs, so you receive all power of HangFire, including the full transparency, free of charge. 

HangFire Monitor was also updated and allows you to see and manage your recurring jobs:

So, HangFire now supports all kinds of background jobs: fire-and-forget, delayed and recurring, and let you process them with ease!
