category: release

This is a maintenance release that add support for Hangfire.Core 1.4.0 for conservative users who are planning to switch to use a more stable [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis) client package, but don't want to upgrade Hangfire.Core. Originally this package supported only &ge; 1.5.0 versions.

* **Changed** – Minimal `Hangfire.Core` dependency for `Hangfire.Pro.Redis` was decreased to 1.4.0.
* **Fixed** – `Dispose` methods don't throw now, and thus don't hide original exceptions.
* **Fixed** – `RedisStorage.ToString `now returns current connected master (however HA still isn't supported officially :wink:).
