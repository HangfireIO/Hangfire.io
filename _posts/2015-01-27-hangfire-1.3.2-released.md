This is a correcting release. Expiration manager does not attempt to remove all the records at once now. Instead, it removes them by 1000 at a time, so you won't experience timeout exceptions anymore. If you had problems with recurring jobs, they were fixed also.

### Release Notes

* **Fixed** – Fatal error occurred during execution of 'Server Core' component.
* **Fixed** – Hangfire version freezes at 1.0.0.0 on Dashboard.
* **Fixed** – Recurring job does not trigger.
* **Fixed** – Sql Timeouts in ExpirationManager.cs.
* **Fixed** – `KeyNotFoundException` on `/hangfire/succeeded` page.

Please see the corresponding [GitHub Release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.3.2) for the details.

### Upgrading

Just update the `Hangfire.Core` NuGet package as usually:

    Update-Package Hangfire.Core
