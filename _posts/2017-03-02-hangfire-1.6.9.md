This is a small correcting release that make it possible to have a workaround for `TimeoutException` exceptions when using **SQL Server** with huge arguments or batches. The `SqlServerOptions.CommandTimeout` option was added to allow to override the default timeout of 30 seconds.

**Fixed** – `TimeoutException` on large arguments or large batches via `SqlServerOptions.CommandTimeout`.
