Patch release that fixes restarts in long running jobs with lightweight servers and SQL Server-based job storage, and a few other minor issues.

#### Hangfire.Core

* **Changed** – Update Bootstrap to the custom version of 3.4.2 to avoid false alerts on unused features.
* **Fixed** – Typos in Portuguese translation (by @VianaArthur).
* **Fixed** – Unnecessary recurring job update transaction when nothing is changed after an error.

#### Hangfire.SqlServer

* **Fixed** – Sliding invisibility timeout isn't prolonged in lightweight servers, causing jobs to be restarted.
