This is a correcting release that is highly recommended to install. It fixes issue related to **daylight savings** in recurring jobs, and **prevents infinite loop** when changing state of a background job that doesn't exists (for example, when deleting a job). 

* **Changed** – Visual Studio 2015 is now required to build the project.
* **Fixed** – Recurring jobs failing after moving clock forward for daylight saving time.
* **Fixed** – Infinite loops when trying to change state of a background job that doesn't exist (by @mkravchuk7).
* **Fixed** – Update StackTraceParser and StackTraceFormatter to prevent critical flaw (by @atifaziz and @lukerogers).
