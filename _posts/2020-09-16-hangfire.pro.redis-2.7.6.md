This version adds support for authenticating with username available in Redis 6 to use [ACL support](https://redis.io/topics/acl). Just add `username=` or `user=` option to your connection string, and you'll be able to use the same Redis instance for multiple tenants with proper data isolation between them.

* **Added** – Allow to pass username to AUTH command available in Redis 6 via "username=" option in connection string.
