This is a maintenance release that fixes `ArgumentNullException` that appears in Dashboard UI and during a call to the `RedisMonitoringApi.Servers` method, when `BackgroundJobServer` instance was resurrected. Resurrection happens when a server was removed from active servers list due to network problems, but then appeared again.

* **Added** – Pub/sub channel count is now reported via dashboard metrics.
* **Changed** – Heartbeat commands are sending with `CommandFlags.HighPriority` to avoid server timeouts.
* **Fixed** – `RedisMonitoringApi.Servers` method throws an exception, when server is resurrected.
