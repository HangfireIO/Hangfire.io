This is a correcting release that fixes hourly/weekly statistics display in Dashboard, and a rare issue when we trying to cancel a recurring job from a client filter.

### Release Notes

* **Fixed** – Incorrect behavior of `RecurringJobScheduler` when job creation has canceled.
* **Fixed** – Fix GetTimelineStats / GetHourlyTimelineStats incorrect order (by [@Dresel](https://github.com/Dresel)).

Please see the corresponding [GitHub Release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.3.4) for the details.


### Upgrading
