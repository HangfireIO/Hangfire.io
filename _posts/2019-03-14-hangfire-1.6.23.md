title: Hangfire 1.6.23
author: odinserj
category: release

This version fixes some issues and acts as an optional trampoline to the upcoming 1.7.0 release to simplify the rolling upgrades. So your current servers will work side-by-side with the newer ones even if you are using SQL Server as a job storage and applied the new migration. There will be more information on upgrading, but this version is nice-to-have (but not required) anyway.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Added** – Slow log to see warning messages when filters or queries take more than 1 minute.
* **Fixed** – Catching `DistributedLockTimeoutException` based on resource name in schedulers (by @bogdandanielb).
* **Fixed** – Serilog context property name does not follow Serilog convention (by @pobiega).
* **Fixed** – Add more guards against `NullReferenceException` on Recurring Jobs page.
* **Fixed** – Don't handle recurring jobs created by newer version of Hangfire.

**Hangfire.AspNetCore**

* **Fixed** – Could not load type `Microsoft.***.FormattedLogValues` in ASP.NET Core 3.0.

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – Make `GetRangeFromSet` to be forward compatible with the 1.7.0 schema.
* **Fixed** – Changed some SQL queries to not to cause index scans when using 1.7.0 schema.
