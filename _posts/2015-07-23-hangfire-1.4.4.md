This is a correcting release that contain some fixes for the Dashboard UI:

* `InvalidCastException` in the Dashboard UI when using *Hangfire.Core* in a project with 
  *Microsoft.Owin* 3.0 package installed. 
* Non-working buttons in counters when other middleware already read the request body, by 
  trying to seek the stream back to the beginning before reading the form data.

As always, you can read the [corresponding release](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases/tag/v1.4.4) on GitHub to see the linked issues.
