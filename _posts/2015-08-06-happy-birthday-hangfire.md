title: Happy birthday, Hangfire!

Two years ago, on Aug, 6, I tired to write custom implementations of background processing over and over again. So I pushed the first [Simple and naive implementation](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/tree/d58a619ebc487ef28bef8c6e7f4df8e1d51ee8c5) commit to the Hangfire repository. It was really simple and naive – 8 files, ~300 lines of code with a lot of todos in comments, and the story began. 

I wanted to have something simple, transparent and extensible for background processing, and I'm sure all of these goals are reached. I'm happy to see Hangfire becomes more and more popular, more and more contributors come in, and more and more extensions appear on NuGet. Here are some numbers:

* 59,724 [downloads](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Hangfire.Core/) on NuGet
* 1,037 [stars](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/stargazers) on GitHub
* 1,955 [commits](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/commits/dev) by 48 [contributors](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/graphs/contributors)
* 44 [versions](https://github.com/HangfireIO/Hangfire/releases) released
* 32 [packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=hangfire) related to Hangfire
* 61 [Hangfire Pro](http://hangfire.io/pro/) customers

But the main thing – Hangfire is still under active development, after two years! Yay!
