This release contains a bunch of fixes for core and integration packages. The most important updates are fix for SQL connection leaks when we failed to acquire a distributed lock, and wrong queue selection, when continuation is created after antecedent job is finished. So upgrade is recommended.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – Continuation is fired on a wrong queue, when parent job is finished before the creation.
* **Fixed** – Impossible to intercept failed state transition before `AutomaticRetryAttribute`.
* **Fixed** – Fixed translation in Chinese localization on home page (by @JustinChia).
* **Fixed** – Don't throw `NullReferenceException`, when state has changed during query on Processing page.
* **Fixed** – `CreateBatchFailedException`, when batch creation takes longer than 1 hour.

**Hangfire.AspNetCore**

* **Fixed** – Types are resolved using the `GetServiceOrCreateInstance` method (by @Tsabo).

**Hangfire.SqlServer**

* **Fixed** – `SqlServerDistributedLock` leaks connections, when lock acquisition is failed.
* **Fixed** – Don't hide errors occurred while running SQL migrations.
* **Fixed** – `KeyNotFoundException` when accessing Deleted Jobs page in Dashboard.
