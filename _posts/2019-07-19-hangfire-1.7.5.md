This is a maintenance release that provides better handling of recurring job scheduling errors, clearly shows when there are problems with fetching statistics in Dashboard UI (thanks, @prochnowc!), doesn't infinitely caches `IBackgroundJobClient` and `IRecurringJobManager` instances that throw *JobStorage.Current is null* exceptions, and also adds the `AddHangfireServer` overload with options-based callback.

**Hangfire.Core**

* **Fixed** – Show error message when there's an error loading the statistics in Dashboard UI (by @prochnowc).
* **Fixed** – Properly handle recurring jobs with null or empty 'Job' field.
* **Fixed** – Disable recurring job when we can't schedule it due to an error.
* **Fixed** – Use `LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly` to avoid caching "JobStorage.Current is null" exceptions.

**Hangfire.AspNetCore** &amp; **Hangfire.NetCore**

* **Fixed** – Add missing overload for the `AddHangfireServer` method with "options" action.
