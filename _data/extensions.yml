- name: Storages
  description: The following projects enable you to use your favorite storage.
               Each storage has its own benefits and drawbacks, but you are
               free to change it at any time, since Hangfire is abstracted
               from a concrete storage.

  description: These projects simplify the integration between Hangfire and
               your favorite IoC Container. They provide custom implementation
               of <code>JobActivator</code> class as well as registration extensions
               that allow you to use unit of work pattern or deterministic disposal
               in your background jobs.
